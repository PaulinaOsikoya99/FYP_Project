### Tasks
 *For this week, I set out to accomplish the following tasks and so far I hope to accomplish the following tasks:*
 
- [x] testing the leds in the different rooms of my house model with the bread board
- [x] testing the leds and adding the button switch functionality to the house
- [ ] speech sythesis research

 

<p></p>
<p></p>

### Update:
<p> last week I focused  on researching using speech synthesis in my project and I tried to find fixes for the deprecated alexa library that is used for communication for microcontroller but while searching on the web I could not find anything tangible to solve the issue so I’m going to resolve to either using a library that can be used with the raspberry pi or esp 32
 </p>

#### Next Steps for this week :

<p>Update on the following things to do this week</p>

- [ ] pir sensor test with servo motor   testing on the esp 32
